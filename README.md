# HTML Basic Recipes Website

### A fully functional website written in HTML filled with my favorite baked goods. This website utilizes absolute and relative links to organize different pages, including a home page and many recipe pages.

## Motivation

This is an introductory project written in HTML to help me learn how to create a website with a boilerplate, absolute and relative links, and images. The project is also for helping me get in the habit of using github.

I also learned a bit of markdown in order to make my first README.md (which is this current file).

I would like to eventually make my own website portfolio and put other projects that I have done on there.

## Technologies

* Any IDE (I used VSCode)
