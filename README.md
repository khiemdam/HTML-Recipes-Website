# HTML Basic Recipes Website

### A fully functional website written in HTML and CSS filled with my favorite baked goods. This website utilizes absolute and relative links to organize different pages, including a home page and many recipe pages.

## Motivation

This is an introductory project written in HTML and CSS to help me learn how to create a website with a boilerplate, absolute and relative links, images, and a style sheet. The project is also for helping me get in the habit of using github. This is mainly a side hobby to learn more about web development and front end development!

I also learned a bit of markdown in order to make my first README.md (which is this current file).

I would like to eventually make my own website portfolio and put other projects that I have done on there.

## Technologies
* HTML
* Any IDE (I used VSCode)

## Installation
Navigate to your desired directory. In your shell/terminal, type in the following:

With SSH Keys:
```
git clone git@github.com:khiemdam/recipes-website.git
```
With HTTPS:
```
git clone https://github.com/khiemdam/recipes-website.git
```


## How To Use
To look at my website, use the link: https://khiemdam.github.io/recipes-website/
Or, you can open the HTML file if you cloned my project.

Follow the recipes and make some desserts!
