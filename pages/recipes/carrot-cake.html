                    <li>3 cups (300 grams) grated peeled carrots, 5 to 6 medium carrots</li>

                    <li>1/2 cup (65 grams) raisins</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>For the Frosting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>8 ounces (225 grams) cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
                    <li>1 ¼ cups (140 grams) powdered sugar</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup (80 ml) cold heavy whipping cream</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup (50 grams) coarsely chopped pecans, for topping cake</li>

                <hr>
                <h1>Steps to Success</h1>
                <h3>The Batter</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Position a rack in the middle of the oven. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, 
                        line the bottom with parchment paper and then grease the top. 
                        Or grease and flour the bottom and sides of both pans.</li>
                    <li>Heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176C).</li>
                    <li>Whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until very well blended.</li>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla.</li>
                    <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, whisking after each one.</li>
                    <li>Switch to a large rubber spatula. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, then add the dry ingredients in three parts, 
                        gently stirring until they disappear and the batter is smooth.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the carrots, nuts, and raisins.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Baking the Cake</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Divide the cake batter between the prepared cake pans.</li>
                    <li>Bake until the tops of the cake layers are springy when touched and when a toothpick 
                        inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Cool cakes in the pans for 15 minutes, then carefully turn the cake layers out onto cooling racks. 
                        Remove the parchment paper and cool completely. If you find that a cake layer is sticking to the bottom of the pan, 
                        leave the cake pan upside down and allow gravity to do its thing.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Finishing Touches</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese with a handheld mixer on medium speed until creamy, about 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Beat in the powdered sugar, a 1/4 cup at a time, until fluffy.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the whipping cream. Beat on medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the frosting is whipped and creamy. 
                        This frosting resembles the texture of whipped cream. Chill covered until ready to frost the cake.</li>
                    <li>When the cake layers are completely cool, frost the top of one cake layer, and place the second cake layer on top.</li>
                    <li>Add the remaining frosting to the top of the carrot cake and use a butter knife or small spatula to swirl the frosting around. 
                        Leave the sides of the cake unfrosted. Finish with a handful of nuts on top.</li>
                </ol>
